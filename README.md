## Overview
This project involves building a QR code component based on the design provided by Frontend Mentor. The challenge is to replicate the design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS. The project is intended to help developers practice and improve their front-end skills by working on a realistic, hands-on coding task.

Key aspects of the project include:
- Creating a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop screens.
- Using semantic HTML5 markup for better accessibility and SEO.
- Implementing custom CSS properties to achieve the desired styling.
- Practicing modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
- Managing assets and ensuring that the final component matches the provided design specifications.
